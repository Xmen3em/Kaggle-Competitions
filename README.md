# Kaggle Competitions Repository

Welcome to my Kaggle Competitions repository! This collection contains various projects and notebooks developed to tackle a range of Kaggle competitions, showcasing different machine-learning techniques, data preprocessing methods, and model optimizations.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each dedicated to a specific Kaggle competition. Inside each folder, you will find:

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- **Datasets**: Links to the datasets used, often hosted on Kaggle.
- **Models**: Saved models, including various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
- **Results**: Visualizations, predictions, and final competition submissions.
- **Documentation**: Detailed README files explaining the approach taken for each competition, including any unique challenges and solutions.

## ðŸ“Š Competitions Covered

- **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques**: A deep dive into predicting home prices using regression models, including feature engineering, and model stacking.
- **Academic Success Prediction**: A Streamlit app developed to predict student academic success, integrating exploratory data analysis, model training, and hyperparameter tuning with a user-friendly interface.
- **[Other Competitions]**: Various other competitions that involve classification, regression, and deep learning tasks.
